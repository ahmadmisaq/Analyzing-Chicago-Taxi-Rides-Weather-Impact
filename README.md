# Analyzing-Chicago-Taxi-Rides-Weather-Impact

Project In this project, we analyzed Chicago taxi data to find popular companies, top drop-off locations, and how weather affects ride times.

Key Findings: Taxi Companies & Rides: A few companies handled most rides on November 15-16, 2017. Top Drop-off Areas: The busiest neighborhoods were identified, likely key business or residential spots. Weather & Ride Duration: A test showed that rides from the Loop to O’Hare took different times on rainy Saturdays.

Conclusion: Chicago’s taxi market is dominated by a few companies, and some areas see more drop-offs. Rainy weather affects travel time, which is important for drivers and passengers.
